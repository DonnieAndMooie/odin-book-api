<h1>Odin-Book API</h1>
A REST API created to be used on the frontend of my Odin-Book project. Created using NodeJS and a MongoDB database. This is my final project as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.

<h2>Frontend</h2>
The frontend repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/DonnieAndMooie/odin-book-frontend">here</a>.
